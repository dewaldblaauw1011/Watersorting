## Watersorting  
The code used in this Java file is for the puzzle game called watersort and how the game is developed in the back-end. How the game worts is you get 5 different categories of bottles with mixed colors that ensures that the puzzle is yet to be completed.

What will be needed from the user is to sort the different categories of bottles so that all the colors are sorted in the same categories. Blue must be in one category, red must be in one category and green must be in one category. You can only select the top color of one category and send it to the top of a target category one at a time.

Here is an visual representation of how the game works if the concept is not understood properly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kIqnGInoTg.
